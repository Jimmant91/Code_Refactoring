# Code_Refactoring!

# About
In this assignment, I refactored an original HTML file and CSS file to better emphasize stability and readability. I also consolidated lines of code within the CSS file in a way that betters the original code without altering the end result display of the webpage.

Additional comments are listed in the files next to their corresponding altered code.
